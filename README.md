# Aggregator Pattern

A Stacks blockchain implementation of a flexible and extensible aggregator pattern using Clarity smart contracts

This project demonstrates a robust and generic aggregator pattern on the Stacks blockchain, providing a flexible framework for managing complex, interrelated resources and events. The implementation showcases a modular approach to building scalable blockchain applications with clear separation of concerns.

## Smart Contracts

### resource-registry
Core contract for managing resource registration and organization:
- Generic resource registration framework
- Flexible group and category management
- Resource ownership tracking
- Configurable resource states

### data-tracker
Handles comprehensive data tracking and validation:
- Generalized data point recording
- Boundary and constraint management
- Event-driven data validation
- Secure data provenance tracking

### event-logger
Manages a flexible event logging system:
- Standardized event recording
- Metadata and context preservation
- Event verification mechanisms
- Immutable event history

### user-manager
Handles flexible user and role management:
- Secure user profile infrastructure
- Role and permission systems
- Performance metric tracking
- Dynamic resource association

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Set up contract ownership and administrative access
3. Register vehicles and create fleet groups
4. Add authorized tracking devices
5. Register drivers and their certifications
6. Begin tracking operations

## Security Features

- Role-based access control
- Secure ownership verification
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Immutable activity logging
- Authorized device management

## Use Cases

- Fleet operations management
- Logistics tracking and optimization
- Maintenance scheduling and compliance
- Driver performance monitoring
- Asset verification and auditing
- Regulatory compliance documentation

This project leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent, and secure platform for managing all aspects of logistics fleet operations.
